  <h1>Hi there,</h1>
	<p>In these pages I will explain what settings I used for setting up my mediaserver and some other stuff that I keep forgetting about.<br>
	This way I can always read back and once in a while will update them.<br>

  Initially, these were the subjects mentioned here:
  <ul>
    <li>Plex</li>
    <li>Sickgear</li>
    <li>Couchpotato</li>
    <li>AutoSub</li>
    <li>Transmission</li>
    <li>Samba for Timemachine</li>
    <li>Cups + Avahi for AirPrint</li>
  </ul>

  All code blocks will be formatted as <code>code<\code><br>
  All programs will be run as your username. 

  Please be aware that this setup is mainly for my own convenience, so I can read it back whenever I want to reinstall my own server.<br>

  If you screw things up that's up to you and I won't/can't help you.</p>
