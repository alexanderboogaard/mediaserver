  <h1>Hi there, I'm Alexander Boogaard!</h1>
	<p>In this tutorial I will explain what to do to make your own mediaserver:<br>

  Install:
  <ul>
    <li>Plex</li>
    <li>Sickgear</li>
    <li>Couchpotato</li>
    <li>AutoSub</li>
    <li>Transmission</li>
    <li>Samba for Timemachine</li>
    <li>Cups + Avahi for AirPrint</li>
  </ul>

  All code blocks will be formatted as `code`<br>
  All programs will be run as your username. 

  Please be aware that this setup is mainly for my own convenience, so I can read it back whenever I want to reinstall my own server.<br>

  If you screw things up that's up to you and I won't help you.</p>
