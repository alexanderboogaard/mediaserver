In this tutorial I will explain what to do to make your own mediaserver:

Install:
* Plex
* Sickgear
* Couchpotato
* AutoSub
* Transmission
* Samba for Timemachine
* Cups + Avahi for AirPrint

All code blocks will be formatted as `code`

Please be aware that this setup is mainly for my own convenience, so I can read it back whenever I want to reinstall my own server.

If you screw things up that's up to you and I won't help you.
