Using this tutorial, you don't need a VPN to create an account.

Wipe old iPhone.
Start adding new account on iPhone.
Select the language that you want, but make sure you select Turkey as country.
Create a **new** appleID using gmail address, but add +f1 to your normal username, so it looks like:
```
normal.username+f1@gmail.com
```
Just select an easy to remember new password.

When asked to enter a verification phone number, you can select your normal phone number. This number is only used to make sure there is a real person behind creating the account.
A verification code is send to your normal number. Enter that verificationnumber on your old phone and the setup will continue.

Gmail redirects everything that is send to this email address to your default email address.
(This way you could also create separate accounts for different websites. Than you can also see who's reselllling/sharing your data without permission.)

Install F1TV app through the appstore.
Propbably you will be asked to create a store account. Enter a Turkish address here. There is no need to provide creditcard details, as you will be paying with giftcards.
Setup App-store to use the Turkish Store.

After setting up the App store and installing the F1TV app, open the F1TV app.
From within the F1TV app, create a F1TV account using a turkish address (maybe the embassy ðŸ˜„), and use the emailadress that you created above (the one with +cheapf1).
Hit the subscribe button to check what the subscription price is (currently 349,99TR = roughly 18 euro).

Go to [Kinguin.net](https://kinguin.net)(or any other store where you can buy turkish itunes cards) and buy the required amount of itunes cards. 
Search for itunes TR to make sure you get the turkish itunes cards because you can't redeem other countries gift cards.
You will notice that you will have to pay a small premium / transaction cost and that the 350TR is now approx 25 euro, but this is still a lot cheaper than the normal F1TV Pro rate of â‚¬95,-.

Redeem the cards you bought and add them to your Appstore account.

Now open the F1TV app again and click subscribe.
The subscription will be paid using the Appstore credit.

On your normal phone you can now open the F1TV Pro app and login using the emailadress and password you chose during account creation. You will see that you have an active subscription for 1 year.

Enjoy the new season.
