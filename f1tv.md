Using this tutorial, you don't need a VPN to create an account.

Wipe old iPhone.
Create new account using gmail address, but add +cheapf1 to your normal username:
```
normal.username+cheapf1@gmail.com
```
Gmail redirects everything to your default email address.
(This way you could also create separate accounts for different websites. Than you can also see who's reselllling/sharing your data without permission.)

Install F1TV app through the appstore
Create a F1tv account using a turkish address (maybe the embassy ðŸ˜„)
Hit the subscribe button to check what the subscription price is (currently 349,99TR = roughly 18 euro)

Go to [Kinguin.net](https://kinguin.net)(or any other store where you can buy turkish itunes cards) and buy the required amount of itunes cards. 
Search for itunes TR to make sure you get the turkish itunes cards because you can't redeem other countries gift cards.
You will notice that you will have to pay a premium and that the 350TR is now approx 25 euro, but this is still a lot cheaper than the normal F1TV Pro rate.

Redeem the cards you bought and add them to the appstore account.

Now open the F1TV app again and click subscribe.
The subscription will be paid using the store credit.

On your normal phone you can now open the F1TV Pro app and login using the turkish account. You will see that you have an active subscription for 1 year.

Enjoy the new season.
